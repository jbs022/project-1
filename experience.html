        <p>I've worked two jobs before, once in food service as a shift leader at <a href="https://www.pancheros.com/" target="_blank">Pancheros</a>
        and as a customer service representative at <a href="https://www.centralbank.net/" target="_blank">Central Bank</a>. Both jobs were great learning
        experiences, but I was studying to be a web developer the whole time I was working at either job.</p>

        <p>I went to high school at Hickman High School, graduating class of 2016. In my senior year is when I developed my interest for web development, and so I
        feel that I owe a lot to that last year for guiding me in this direction.</p>
        <p>After gradutation I went to Moberly Area Community College for two years, and I am currently enrolled in Columbia College to finish my Assiocate of Arts degree.</p>
